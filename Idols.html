			<h2>WELCOME TO MY IDOLS</h2>

			<p>
				I have SO MANY idols that I look up to. If I was to write all of them, I would be writing more than 10 paragraphs! To not make the people that are viewing this website read 10+ paragraphs I will only write about the idols that I look up to in a show called"Youth With You 3". (If I have time I will update more. IF!)  
			</p>

			<p>
				There is Chinese show(选秀节目) that will choose a boy idol group after a few months.(Apparently Google tells me it's called a Talent Show???) This is already the fourth season, I have watched Season 1(Idol Producer) and Season 3(Youth With You 2). Do not ask why season 1 has a whole different name.(It's because during the first season the director and people did not apply for the copyrights.)  
			</p>

			<p>
				I have 9 people that I really like in the show. They are Tony Yu(JingTian Yu), YiZhou Luo, HuaiWei Lian, JoJo Tang(JiuZhou Tang), Kachine Sun(YingHao Sun), YiHang Sun, Neil Liu(GuanYou Liu), X Duan(XingXing Duan), Waston Chang(HuaSen Chang).(I hope that's how you spell their english names...) I will be spliting them into 2 groups to be talking about. The 21+ and the 21- age groups.

			<p>
				In Chinese it is last name first and first name in the end. In English it is first name and then last. So some of their names might be in both Chinese and English versions. Sorry 
			</p>

			<p>
				ALSO! In these types of shows they will be given an rating. Start with A-N. A as the best, B as in good, C as in okay, D as in not very good, and N as in "NEW" which means they need improvement.

			<p>
				The reason that I like them are because they work very hard towards their goals and have very good self control. They would go 1-3 days without sleeping or only sleeping less than 3 hours a day to learn the theme song. Also since Chinese idols must be like VERY skinny(I do not know why, I just want them to he healthly) they barely eat any calories. Most of them are 50-65KG and have a height of 180+ which is not very healthly. They get hurt very often, but they never stop practicing before going on stage. They would get cyber bullied VERY OFTEN there will always be bad comments under their social medias and videos. However, none of them stopped and turned the bad comments into something to make them keep working harder. They are the light in my life and are the reason that I work hard and aim for my goals. Sometimes I just want to give up on hard things in my life, the ONLY reason I didn't give up is because of them. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The show has been stopped because of some stupid fans. It's because some fans(Irrational fans!) they were dumping "milk" into lakes(I think). I feel VERY bad for the trainee. They worked hard for 3+ months just to debut and just a few days before the debut the show was stopped. I must say having an idol is a good thing but YOU MUST BE san. Having an idol should make you improve not regress.
