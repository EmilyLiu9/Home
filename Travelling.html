				<h2>WELCOME TO TRAVEL</h2>

				<p>
					I will be recommending places that you should travel to in China. (Do not ask why my page is 90% about China, it's because I know more Chinese things) In China there are places that you might see hundred thousands of people in one location if you do not choose the correct places and time. For example, the Forbidden City. It might look like this when there are a lot of people. 
				</p>

				<h4>Forbidden City</h4>
			
				<p>
					Since I already mentioned the Forbidden City then the first place I recommend everyone to visit is the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City in Beijing is the imperial palace of China during the Ming and Qing Dynasties . The Forbidden City in Beijing is centered on three halls, covering an area of ​​about 720,000 square meters, with a construction area of ​​about 150,000 square meters, more than 70 large and small palaces and more than 9,000 houses. There are limited of tickets everyday so if you want to go please book tickets ahead of time.

					Qin Shi Huang Mausoleum Museum is located in Shaanxi Province in Xi'an Lintong District , is the Terracotta Warriors Museum based, Qin Shi Huang Mausoleum Park ( Laguna Hills Park ) as the basis of a large site museum; also to Qin Shi Huang Mausoleum and many Horses is The main body, based on the protection and display of the archaeological site itself and its environment, is a public cultural space that integrates multiple functions such as education, scientific research, tourism, and leisure. Those warriors might look small but there are tall! I went in 2019 when I was 175cm and I look short beside them...(I'm shorter than warriors that are made of rocks...)

				<h4>Great Wall of China</h4>
				<p>
					The Great Wall of China just amazing! Great Wall (The Great Wall), also known as the Great Wall, the ancient Chinese military fortifications , is a tall, strong and continuous long- Yuan , for every action limit of Diji. The Great Wall is not a purely isolated city wall, but a defense system with the city wall as the main body and a large number of cities, barriers, pavilions, and landmarks. This wall was made by people, 0 machines were involved!!! If you would like to climb it, please be ready to walk 20000+ steps

				<p>
				All these places above I recommend to wear Running shoes(from my own experiences) also be ready to take picture. Bring water and food. The water at these places are just expensive, not worth it if you can buy a bottled water with ￥1 in the city.
